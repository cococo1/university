**Lab 1**: To calculate and display argument values and function set value by several expressions, for the set interval хn ≤ x ≤ хk and dx step of argument variations. Parameters a, b, c – real numbers.

--

**Lab 2**: For one-dimensional array from n elements, define the values and quantity of the minimal elements, and their positions in array.

--

**Lab 3**: Count up quantity of local minimums of array. The element of array is a local minimum, if it is strictly less than its neighbors.

--
**Lab 4**: For given bidimensional array from n lines and m columns, display the following operations menu:

1. Dynamic memory allocation for a bidimensional array 
2. Input of array elements from keyboard 
3. Filling with random numbers 
4. Sorting of elements of array (in variants) 
5. Output of elements of array on the screen 
6. Clearing the allocated memory for array 
0. Exit from the program.

Develop functions for realization of operations of the menu. 


--
**Lab 5**: For given set sort the words in alphabetic order.


--
**Lab 6**: For given array of elements of structure type (in variants) to display the following operations menu:

1. Dynamic memory allocation for structure array. 
2. Input of array elements from keyboard. 
3. Searching the element in array. 
4. Sorting of array. 
5. Editing the element of array. 
6. Adding a new element in the end. 
7. Deleting the specified element from array. 
8. Inserting a new element. 
9. Recording array elements in a file. 
10. Reading array elements from a file. 
11. Output of array elements to the screen. 
12. Clearing the memory allocated for array. 
13. Exit from the program.
