Programming I
==========

1-st year course at Computer Science. 

--

**Lab 1**: Given a function, compute and display its values on a given interval,
with a given step. Parameters of the function are also given.

--

**Lab 2**: For one-dimensional array of n elements, find the values, positions
and number of minimal elements.

--

**Lab 3**: Find how many local minimas are in a 2-D array. An element is a local
minima, if it is strictly less than all its neighbours.

--

**Lab 4**: For given bidimensional array from n lines and m columns, display
the following menu of operations:

1. Dynamic memory allocation for a bidimensional array.
2. Input data from keyboard.
3. Setting all elements to random values.
4. Sorting.
5. Output on the screen.
6. Clearing the allocated memory.
0. Quit the program.

Develop functions for realization of operations of the menu. 

--
**Lab 5**: For given set sort the words in alphabetic order.

--

**Lab 6**: For given array of elements of structure type (in variants) to
display the following menu of operations:

1. Dynamic memory allocation for an array of structures. 
2. Input data from keyboard. 
3. Searching for a specific element.
4. Sorting
5. Editing a specified element.
6. Adding a new element at the end. 
7. Deleting the specified element.
8. Inserting a new element. 
9. Writing the array to a file. 
10. Reading the array from a file. 
11. Output on the screen. 
12. Clearing the allocated memory.
13. Quit the program.

Structure the CAR with fields: model, country, date of manufacturing, capacity of the engine, cost.
