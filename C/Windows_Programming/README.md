Windows Programming
==========

3-rd year course at Computer Science. 

--

**Lab 1**: Create a Windows application which will contain the message “Name Surname’s laboratory work” in the centre of client area, with corresponding author’s name. While changing the size of the window, the message must remain in the centre of the client area. 

--

**Lab 2**: Write a program which will present in the client area a simple animation, obtained using GDI primitives.
--

**Lab 3**: Write a program which draws a Bezier curve, using standard GDI functions and a Bezier curve using computations and formulas.

--

**Lab 4**: Write a program which displays in its client area a drawing, which can be moved → to right, ← to left, ↑ up and ↓ down using corresponding keys. Also, create the possibility to rotate the drawing using special keys.

--

**Lab 6**: Write a program which does the following:

1. Displays a digital clock (Hour:Min:Sec); use a timer to update its time every second;

2. Displays an analogic clock (draw the clock and its hands using GDI primitives); use a timer to update its time every second.

--

**Lab 7**: Write a program which displays three geometrical figures. The program should include:

1. Three radio buttons, with just one selected at once. At validation of a radio button, a geometrical figure is displayed;

2. Three checkboxes. When one is activated, the others are disabled. For each checkbox a corresponding colour should be assigned. At validation of a certain checkbox the geometrical figure is coloured in the corresponding colour; 

3. Two push buttons. Pressing one of them, the figure starts movement over a circle and pressing the other stops the movement.
