Data Structures and Algorithms
==========

1-st year course at Computer Science. 

--

**Lab 1**: Create three files in C language for realization and usage of АDT
«Array of structures».

1. A heading file with extension .h for description of the data structure, and 
also for prototypes of functions, providing operations for array processing. 

2. A file with extension .c for definition of functions, declared in the header
file.

3. A client file - function mаin () for processing the array of structures
showing on the screen the menu of operations: dynamic memory allocation for
array, array input from the keyboard, displaying array on the screen, element
searching, editing the element, sorting the array elements, adding a new element
, removing the specified element, inserting a new element, writing array to the 
file, array reading from the file, cleaning the memory allocated for array,
exit the program.

Variant No. 6: 
Structure CAR with fields: model, country, date of manufacturing, capacity
of the engine, cost.

**Lab 2**: Create three files in the C language for the implementation and usage
of ADT «simply list» to the specified topic in the laboratory of the processing
 operations.

1. A heading file .h to describe the data structure element of the list (in
 variants), and also for function prototypes that provides basic operations
  processing the list. 

2. A file with extension .cpp for a certain function (text functions), declared
 in the header file . 

3. A user file - the function main () for processing through the list specified
 in the topic of the laboratory operations, displaying the menu on the screen
 for those operations.

Variant No. 6 : 
Structure CAR with fields: model, country, date of manufacturing, capacity of
 the engine, cost and the field next with the address of the next element.

**Lab 3**: Complete those three files from Laboratory Work 8 for usage of ADT
 «Simple List» for realization of mentioned operations.

Variant No. 6 : 
Structure CAR with fields: model, country, date of manufacturing, capacity of
 the engine, cost and the field next with the address of the next element.

--
**Lab 4**: Create three files in C language for implementation and usage of ADT
 «Binary tree» with operations of processing the tree while traversing the nodes
 using the iterative algorithms.

Variant No. 6 : 
Structure CAR with fields: model, country, date of manufacturing, capacity of
 the engine, cost and the fields left and right with the addresses of other
 cars.
