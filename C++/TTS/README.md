**TTS** is the course work for **Data Structures and Algorithms** course, mostly written in C, but also using some custom classes from C++ Builder for Windows components. It also contains just a few sounds examples used for speech synthesis. To use this code there is a need to create a project on Windows in C++ Builder and add the corresponding components.
