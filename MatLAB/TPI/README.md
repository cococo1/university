**Lab 1**

*Problem 1* Write a program that will simulate the tossing of a coin N times. Run this program with N=100,1000,10000,100000. Record the results. Compute the proportion of heads and tails . Also record the proportion of heads and tails minus ½. Comment your results .

*Problem 2* Consider the game played by Chevalier de Mere ( in four rolls of a die at least one six would turn up). Write a program that will simulate it. Run this program for 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 times. Compute the percentage of winnings .Comment your result.

*Problem 3* Consider the second game played by Chevalier de Mere ( in 24 rolls of a pair of dice at least one pair of sixes would turn up).Write a program that will simulate it. Run this program 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 times. Compute the percentage of winnings. Repeat this for 25 rolls (instead of 24 rolls). Comment your results.

*Problem 4* Peter and Paul play a game called heads and tails .In this game a fair coin is tossed a sequence of times – we choose 40 .Each time a head comes up, Peter wins 1 cent from Paul, and each time a tail comes up,  Peter loses 1 cent to Paul. Write a program that simulates this game. Draw the Peter’s winnings graph in one game .It is natural to ask for the probability that he will win j cents; here j could be any number from -40 to 40.  Play this game 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 times. Draw the bar-graph showing Peter’s final winnings . Comment your results.

*Problem 5* Four horses (A,B,C,D) have raced many times . It is estimated that A wins 30 percent of the times, B 40 percent of the times, C 20 percent of the times and D the remaining 10 percent of the times .Simulate the horse race N=100, 1000, 10000, 100000 times. Comment your results.

*Problem 6* Write a program that will simulate the roll of three dice a large number of times and keep track of the proportion of the times that the sum of the outcomes is 9 and the proportion that the sum of the outcomes is 10. Comment your results.

**Lab 2**

*Problem 1* Suppose you have in a room N people and consider their birthdays. What is the probability that at least two of them will have the same birthday ? Simulate this experiment on computer for N=10,…,40 . Comment your results.

*Problem 2* 
1. Write your own program that will list all the permutations of N objects.
2. Write your own program that will list all binomial coefficients  (all the subsets of length M from a set of length N ).
3. Estimate using Stirling’s formula.

*Problem 3* Write a program that will compute the binomial probabilities b(n,p,j)=q=1-p;

*Problem 4* Use the program from problem 3 to find the probability that in 100 tosses of a fair coin , the number of heads that turns up will lie between 35 and 65, 40 and 60  , and between 45 and 55 .Also , simulate these events on computer .

*Problem 5* Use the program from problem 3 to check that b(2n,0.5,n)≈1/ for sufficiently large values of n .Try values n=10,11,…,25 .
