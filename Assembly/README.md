2-nd year course at Computer Science.

--

**Lab 1 - 8086 microprocessor architecture** 

1.	EU and BIU;

2.	General Purpose registers;

3.	Special purpose registers;

4.	Segment registers and memory segmentation.

--

**Lab 2 - Addressing modes** 

1.	Declare memory spaces for 3 variables (DB, DW and DD). Use immediate addressing mode to load these variables in general purpose registers. 

2.	Store the content of the used registers in stack, reset registers with mov instruction and then restore the content of the registers from stack.

3.	Use as many memory addressing modes as is possible to store the content of the registers in memory and vice-versa. Consider DS=ADDRESS. Reset each time registers with xor instruction. 

--

**Lab 3 - Arithmetic and logic instructions**

1.	Calculate 5 DW elements of the string according to the following rule:
(according to the variant)

2.	Find the arithmetic average of the elements. 

--

**Lab 4 - Conditional and unconditional jumps**

Calculate the expression (according to the variant).

--

**Lab 5 - Procedures**

1.	Declare a 10-size array X with integer DW numbers.

2.	Calculate their sum (use procedure).

3.	Use two procedures to calculate the requested condition (according to the variant).

--

**Lab 6 - Software interrupts**

1. Elaborate a program that performs the search of the characters that correspond to the student name and surname in the defined string of characters.

2. Use software interrupts to visualize the results (arrange characters in a column, string, diagonal, change background color, use messages in case if the certain character is not finding).
